# Medical-Appointment-No-Shows-Project
This project uses exploratory data analysis to investigate the case of patients turn-up for their appointments.
In this project, we will be studying a case of patients that have scheduled medical appointments with their physicians, who received all the necessary instructions about their appointment but failed to show up on the appointed date. We will be analysing the selected dataset to identify trends and patterns among the existing variables (independent and dependent) that may facilitate the prediction of whether a patient will show up or not for a scheduled medical appointment.

The analysis will be tackling the following research questions:


Which gender showed up the more for the doctor's medical appointment?


Did scholarships influence the attendance of patients to doctor's medical appointment?


Did the disease type influence patients to show up for appointment?


If true, which disease type influenced patients the most?


Did SMS improve on patients' attendance?


What is the relationship between the age, gender, and attendance to doctor's appointment?
